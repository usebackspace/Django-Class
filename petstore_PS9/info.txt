petstore - Phase 9

1. We will work on Buy Now button

2. In this phase we have 3 functions
    1.buynow()
    2.buynow_payment()
    3.buynow_payment_success()

3. buynow(): In this we will fetch id of particular pet from pet_details.html through i.e pet.id

    <a href="{% url "buynow" pet.id %}" class="btn btn-success my-2">Buy Now</a>
    
    1. Now we will fetch object from that particular pet.id 
   
        pet = Pet.objects.get(pk=id)

    2. Now we calculate final_price and render it to buynow.html 

    3. Now we select address in buynow.html and click on proceed to payment.

    4. Now when click on proceed to payment it will render to buynow_payment() with pet.id
        
        <form method="post" action="{% url 'buynowpayment' pet.id %}">
   
        as we have put address field in <form> tag so we will use name="buynow_selected_address" to fetch value 
        value="{{ add.id }}" from radio button in  buynow_payment() function     


4. buynow_payment(): In this function we use fetch pet.id and buynow_selected_address to calculate price and 
                     to send pet.id and buynow_selected_address to buynow_payment_success() to save order after
                     payment

    1. we will use same paypal code as we have used in payment() function, adding some extra field in return_url 
       in paypal
        
        'return_url': f"http://{host}{reverse('buynowpaymentsuccess', args=[selected_address_id,id])}",

    2. After successful payment it will redirect to buynow_payment_success() function with selected_address_id and id
       

5. buynow_payment_success(): In this function we will fetch customer details and pet details through selected_address_id and id
   
    1. customer_data = Customer.objects.get(pk=selected_address_id) # will fetch details of particular customer object
        
    2. pet = Pet.objects.get(pk=id)  # will fetch details of particular Pet object

    3. After fetching the data we will save the fetch data into Order Model
        Order(user=user,customer=customer_data,pet=pet,quantity=1).save()
        
    4. And lastly render to buynow_payment_success.html
